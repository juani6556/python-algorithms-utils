# Python Algorithms & Utilities

A collection of clean, production-ready Python implementations of classic algorithms and practical utility functions.  
Designed for learning, interviews, and real-world usage.

This repository demonstrates strong fundamentals in:
- Algorithms & Data Structures  
- Recursion  
- Graph theory  
- Divide-and-conquer strategies  
- Secure random generation  
- Clean and modular Python project structure

## 🚀 Algorithms

### **🔹 Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
File: `algorithms/dijkstra.py`  
- Computes the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes  
- Uses a priority queue (`heapq`)  
- Core algorithm in graph theory, routing, ML graph-based methods  

### **🔹 Merge Sort**
File: `algorithms/merge_sort.py`  
- Classic divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm  
- Stable, O(n log n), fundamental in computer science  
- Useful for interview prep  

### **🔹 Tower of Hanoi**
File: `algorithms/hanoi.py`  
- Recursive solution returning the full list of moves  
- Demonstrates recursion, call stack behavior, and algorithmic thinking

## 🛠️ Utilities

### **🔹 Secure Password Generator**
File: `utilities/secure_password.py`  
- Uses Python’s `secrets` module for cryptographic-grade randomness  
- Supports configurable rules (uppercase, digits, symbols, etc.)  
- Demonstrates security best practices
